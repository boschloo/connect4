# Learning to Play with Inductive Programming

The directory [Reference program](./1.reference program/) contains the Connect Four program as written at the beginning of the research. File [c4_gdl.lp](./1.reference program/c4_gdl.lp) is this program according to GDL-conventions. File [c4_asp.lp](./asp/1.reference program/c4_asp.lp) is a somewhat simplified version used in learning the rules with ILASP, supplemented with facts and directives to give a meaningful output when solved with clingo. The output of the program is added.
